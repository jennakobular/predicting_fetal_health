# Using Cardiotocograms to Predict Fetal Health

This repository contains the code used to build several machine-learning models which were used to predict fetal health. 

# Summary
The reduction of child mortality is considered a key indicator of human progress. Fetal death refers to the intrauterine death of a fetus during pregnancy. Newborn death accounts for 47% of all child deaths under the age of 5. Fetal health is monitored prior to and during labor by using cardiotocography. A cardiotocogram measures fetal heart rate and uterine contractions. The results have generally required a specialist to review them and assess if further action needs to be taken. This study looks to see if machine learning can help accurately predict fetal health. Using the results from 2126 records, it was found that machine learning can be an asset to maternal-fetal health. After implementing five different machine learning algorithms, a random forest classifier was able to predict fetal health with 94.6% accuracy. While machine learning will not replace the need for human review, it can help reduce medical errors and increase cost-effectiveness.
